# Placeholder Packages

Python GTK Spellcheck is imported as `gtkspellcheck` and used to ship a package `pylocales`. Having different names for the PyPi package and the actual import is confusing for users can can be a security risk if someone publishes a package under one of the names. Hence, we reserve the packages `gtkspellcheck` and `pylocales` on PyPi.
